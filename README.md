Just an educational repo?  
**1. Course name:** *CICS 191: First Year Seminar -- Math Puzzles*  
**2. Favorite In-Class puzzle:** The process-of-elimination puzzles like the Harry Potter potion one  
**3. Favorite Out-Of-Class puzzle:** I don't really have a favorite puzzle, but I like the type that involves using logic and a process of elimination, quite similar to the Harry Potter one above.
